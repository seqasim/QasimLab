# Rules

There are some general rules and good practices to follow.

## Files and folders

1. Keep data and codebases in `/projects/` directory 
2. Dump temporary outputs that you don’t mind getting deleted in **90** days in `/scratch/[netid]`
3. Only use your `/home/` directory to store your Jupyter notebooks and build your conda environments! It is limited to 100 GB
4. Keep your custom Git repositories in `/projects/f_sq140_1/GitRepos`
    a. Git commit and push from local (e.g. vscode, cursor) frequently
        1. Do NOT change these repos ON Amarel themselves (for simplicity’s sake)
    b. Git pull frequently on Amarel to keep them updated
